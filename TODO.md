## Roxygen Overview

The first line will be the title for the function (here “Illustration of crayon colors”).

Include a blank #' line and then write a longer description. (“Creates a plot of the crayon colors in …”).

Roxygen comments start with `#'` so you can continue to use regular comments for other purposes.
